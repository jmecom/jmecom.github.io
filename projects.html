    <h3>Gorgon</h3>
    <a href="http://gorgon.wustl.edu/">Home site</a>
    <p>Gorgon is an interactive molecular modeling system, developed by WashU and Baylor, that I contributed to
    as part of an independent study for Professor Tao Ju. I primarily worked on a set of validation tools that evaluate
    the quality of molecular models using root-mean-square deviation or Hausdorff distance. I also added a feature that, given a reference
    and a comparison model, colors like-atoms based on their distance apart. This feature and the 'validation' tab are visible in the
    image below.

    <a href="http://github.com/jmecom/Virtual6502"><h3>Virtual6502</h3></a>
    <p>Virtual6502 is an emulator for the NES' 6502 CPU, written in Python.
    It provides two modes - interactive and from-file. The interactive prompt allows you
    to write 6502 Assembly straight from an interactive command-prompt. It also provides
    special functions to display the state of the CPU. Loading a file runs all of the
    6502 Assembly instructions defined in the file.</p>

    <a href="http://jmecom.github.io/star-graph/">View it here</a>
    <p>Star Graph renders points in a dataset as stars in an interactive, 3D galaxy. It was made
    by myself and <a href="https://github.com/Ahris">Alice Wang</a> during December 2014, using Javascript and Three.js.
    In its current state, we've taken game reviews from Metacritic and plotted them in space, where the games with better reviews are located
    in the middle of the galaxy.</p>

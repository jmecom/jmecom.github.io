# About

Hi, I'm Jordan Mecom. I'm a Software Engineer at Square, working on Caviar. 
I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in May 2016. 

Computer vision and machine learning are at the center of my interests, but I also love computational photography and
computer graphics. When I'm not writing code, I play the drums, watch eSports (go SKT!), play games, and make
digital art. 

If you're curious about what I've been up to lately, check out my [projects page](/projects). 
To take a look at my past work, head over to my [resume](/resume).
Feel free to email me at `jmecom AT wustl DOT edu` if you want to reach out about anything.

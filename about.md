# About

Hi, I'm Jordan Mecom. I'm currently a computer science student 
at Washington University in St. Louis but in a few months I'll
be working at Square as a Software Engineer. Some of my computer
science interests are computer graphics, computer vision, computational
photography, emulation, romhacking, and making games. When I'm not writing
code, I love playing drums, playing games, watching eSports, and making
digital art. 

If you're curious about what I've been up to lately, check out my [projects page](/projects). 
To take a look at my past work, head over to my [resume](/resume).
Feel free to email me at `jmecom AT wustl DOT edu` if you want to reach out.

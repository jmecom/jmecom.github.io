Gradient-domain image processing is a technique with numerous applications. This project explores image blending and non-photo realistic rendering. Given an input image, gradient domain image processing first finds the gradient of the given image, and then solves for a new image using a system of equations. The equations act as constraints, defining what problem is solved. In this project, we will explore a simple toy problem, Poisson blending, and non-photo realistic rendering. The code for can be found [here](https://github.com/jmecom/gradient-domain-fusion). Alice Wang and I worked together on this project.

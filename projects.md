# Projects

### Computer vision, graphics, photography

#### Non-photorealistic rendering

<html><div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../../images/gradient-domain-fusion/sf-npr-big.png" /></div></html>

This project uses Poisson blending to (1) combine images, and (2) to re-render them non-photorealistically. The full writeup is [here](http://ahris.github.io/articles/gradient-domain-fusion/).

#### Image analogies

<html><div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../../images/image-analogies/header2.PNG" /></div></html>

Image analogies provides a framework to learn complex, non-linear image filters with one training example. See the full writeup [here](/projects/computational-photography/final-project/)

#### Video textures

</p>

Video textures are "infinitely-repeating" images that capture the essence of a particular video. Read more [here](/projects/computational-photography/video-textures/)

#### Gorgon

</p>

Gorgon is an interactive molecular modeling system, developed by WashU and Baylor, that I contributed to as part of an independent study for Professor Tao Ju. Gorgon's homepage can be viewed [here](http://gorgon.wustl.edu/).

#### Image quilting

<html><div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../../images/texture-synthesis/before-after-quilt.PNG" /></div></html>

Texture synthesis is the process of generating a larger texture image from a smaller source image. This project uses an approach developed by Efros and Freeman called Image Quilting. See the full writeup [here](/projects/computational-photography/texture-synthesis/).


#### Image alignment

<html><div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../../images/gorskii-collection/tzar.jpg" /></div></html>

This project automatically aligns, cleans up, and displays a single color photograph from a glass plate negative, sourced from the Prokudin-Gorskii image collection available at the Library of Congress. Full writeup [here](/projects/computational-photography/image-alignment/).

#### Diamond-Square

<html><div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../../images/ds-example-small.png" /></div></html>

The Diamond-Square algorithm is a common technique used to generate random heightmaps, used for procedural terrain generation. I blogged about it [here](/blog/2015/diamond-square/).

### Emulators

#### CHIP-8

<html><div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../../images/chip8.png" /></div></html>

I developed a CHIP-8 emulator in Javascript; repository [here](https://github.com/jmecom/chip8/). 

### Games

#### Fae (Global Game Jam 2015)

<div class="text-center" style="text-align:center"><img src="../images/fae1.png"></div>

Fae is a short puzzle-platformer made in under 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2015. [Play it here](http://jmecom.github.io/global-game-jam-15/).

#### Race the Rainbow (Global Game Jam 2014)

</div>

I worked on the art for Race the Rainbow, a multiplayer racing game made in under 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2014. [Download and play it here](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/race-rainbow). [Repository here](https://github.com/kwanzek/GGJ2014).
